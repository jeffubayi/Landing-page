#  A BLOG ABOUT ETHICAL HACKING AND PENTESTING

##  About
Hello, welcome to my little corner of the web.

I like to figure out technology and experiment with it in ways I
never imagined.I also have a strong desire to share this information with
others and to explain it to people whose only qualification may be the desire to learn.

```
"The quiter you become, 
 the more your able to listen.
